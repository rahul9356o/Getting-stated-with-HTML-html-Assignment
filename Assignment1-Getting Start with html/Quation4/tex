HTML Tags:
Tags are the building blocks of HTML.
They are used to define elements on a web page.
Tags are written in angle brackets, like <tagname>.
Tags are often used in pairs, with an opening tag and a closing tag. The closing tag has a forward slash before the tag name, like </tagname>.
Example of a simple HTML tag pair:

html

<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
In this example:

<p> is the opening tag.
</p> is the closing tag.

The content, "This is a paragraph," is enclosed between the opening and closing tags and represents the 
HTML element.



HTML Elements:
An HTML element is a complete set of tags and the content they enclose.
Elements can be as simple as a single pair of tags with content (like the paragraph example), or they can be more complex with nested elements.
Elements are the basic structural units of an HTML document, defining the different parts of a page, such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, lists, etc.
Example of a more complex HTML element with nested elements:

In this example:

<div> is the opening tag for a division or section.
</div> is the closing tag.
Inside the div element, there are several other elements, including <h2>, <p>, and <ul>.
HTML elements are the building blocks that structure the content of a web page. By combining different elements and organizing them hierarchically, you can create complex and well-organized web pages.
